# Earthquake-Acceleration-Responce-Spectrum

Using **single degree of freedom system** to analyze the influence of strong earthquake waveform to building, and also use **high-pass and low-pass filter** to preprocess our data, and calculate three component waveforms **PSD (Maximum Relative Pseudo-Displacement), PSV (Maximum Relative Pseudo-Velocity), PSA (MaximumAbsolute Pseudo- Acceleration).**
