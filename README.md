# Earthquake-Acceleration-Responce-Spectrum

Using **single degree of freedom system** to analyze the influence of strong earthquake waveform to building, and also use **high-pass and low-pass filter** to preprocess our data, and calculate three component waveforms **PSD (Maximum Relative Pseudo-Displacement), PSV (Maximum Relative Pseudo-Velocity), PSA (MaximumAbsolute Pseudo- Acceleration).**

## File descriptipon

**pseudo_spectrum.py** is the main code, including all preprocess and caculation

**HWA019 Acceleration Responce Spectrum.png** one of examples which is 2018 0206 Hualian earthquake record from station HWA019. The image show the three component PSA

## High-pass and low-pass filter

## PSD, PSV, PSA caculation

## Example for 2018 0206 Hualian earthquake, station: HWA019
